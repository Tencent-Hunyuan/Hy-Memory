# Changelog and Release Status

Hy Memory and MemHub are versioned and released independently.

## Hy Memory 2.0.3 — 2026-10-17

- Added an optional runtime HTTP transport factory so embedded products can
  enforce request budgets without wrapping or restricting SDK local-store
  access.
- Published
  [`hy-memory==2.0.3`](https://pypi.org/project/hy-memory/2.0.3/) with
  unchanged memory extraction, reconciliation, storage, and Coding/Working
  behavior.

## Unreleased

- Clarified that `add(metadata=...)` carries legacy SDK processing options,
  while persistent caller business context belongs in `meta`.
- Added an opt-in `get(..., include_raw=True)` path for reading `L1_RAW`
  memories, including memories written in lite mode. The default remains
  hidden for backward compatibility.
- Removed MemHub's task-scoped HyPermission store wrappers and global
  model-content consent switch. The trusted embedded Hy Memory SDK now uses
  its native local stores directly.
- Existing installations ignore the retired config flag, readmit previously
  parked pre-invocation work, and drop only the obsolete
  `hy_node_permissions` proof table. Evidence, governed memories, model
  profiles, SDK stores, and source/host grants are preserved.

## Hy Memory 2.0.2 — 2026-10-17

- Published
  [`hy-memory==2.0.2`](https://pypi.org/project/hy-memory/2.0.2/) with the
  current SDK fixes and Apache-2.0 package metadata.

## Hy Memory 2.0.1 — 2026-10-16

- Published the Python distribution as
  [`hy-memory==2.0.1`](https://pypi.org/project/hy-memory/2.0.1/).
- The repository subsequently adopted the Hy-Memory Apache-2.0 license text.
  Because PyPI release metadata is immutable, the next SDK patch release must
  carry the updated license metadata; `2.0.1` retains its published metadata.

## MemHub 1.0.3 — Unreleased

- Updated the source version to `1.0.3` (build 7).
- Pinned the public SDK to `hy-memory==2.0.3`.
- Removed the HyPermission store wrappers and global model-content consent
  switch; the trusted embedded SDK now uses native local stores.
- Prevented uncertain writes from blocking later source work and added one
  reconciled automatic retry after ten seconds.
- Added product-facing memory pipeline counters and the log troubleshooting
  runbook.
- Allowed a verified packaged Desktop Runtime from a different commit to take
  over an equal-build install atomically while preserving downgrade and
  tamper refusal.

## MemHub 1.0.2 — 2026-10-17

- Updated the source version to `1.0.2` (build 6).
- Pinned the public SDK to `hy-memory==2.0.2`.
- Pinned `onnxruntime==1.23.2` to retain macOS x64 packaging support.
- Fixed relaunch and upgrade failures when a prior managed Runtime exists.
- Embedded canonical build identity when an external packaging pipeline omits
  release environment fields.
- Added automatic Linux Runtime upload to tagged Draft Releases.

## MemHub 1.0.1 — Superseded before release

- The candidate tag was not published as a GitHub Release; `1.0.2` replaces it
  after the managed-Runtime relaunch fix.

## MemHub 1.0.0

- Published the initial GitHub Release with macOS arm64 and Linux Runtime
  artifacts.
